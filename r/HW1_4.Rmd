Setup
---
Nuts and bolts from raw files to merged data
```
#set wd
setwd("/Users/mghaz/github/data-viz/r")
#load libraries
require(plyr)
#reading and assigning names to csv files
nmis <- read.csv("Health_Mopup_and_Baseline_NMIS_Facility.csv")
lgas <- read.csv("lgas.csv")
#merge the two files by unique_lga to match lga-level data to NMIS facilities data
merged <- merge(nmis , lgas, by="unique_lga")
#create a subset of the observations in southern provinces
southern <- merged[ which(merged$zone=='Southwest'| merged$zone=='South-South'| merged$zone== 'Southeast'), ]
#keep only the data I want from the southern states' data
mydata <- subset(southern, select = c("state", "pop_2006", "area_sq_km","num_nurses_fulltime", "num_nursemidwives_fulltime", "num_doctors_fulltime"))
#remove NAs from data
mydata <- na.omit(mydata)
```

Compile Crucial Data
---
Create dataframe with needed data by state, listed by descending population
```
#create dataframe with total nurses, midwives, doctors by state
mydata2 <- ddply(mydata,.(state), summarise, Nurses = sum(num_nurses_fulltime), Midwives = sum(num_nursemidwives_fulltime), Doctors = sum(num_doctors_fulltime))
#create a dataframe of population and area data
popa <- subset(mydata, select =c("state","pop_2006","area_sq_km"))
#select the unique values to eliminate repeated values within the same state
popa2 <- unique(popa)
#organize popa2 by state name to get dataframe summing up LGA-level data to get state-level data
popa3<- ddply(popa2,.(state), summarise, Area = sum(area_sq_km), Pop = sum(pop_2006))
#merge popa2 and mydata2 to get all the data I need listed by state
allstate <- merge(popa3, mydata2, by = "state")
```

Display More Data
---
Use data in dataframe to add desired info and arrange by population (in descending order)
``` 
#create a column for total medical personnel
allstate1 <- transform(allstate, Total.med = Nurses+Midwives+Doctors)
#order data by state population descending 
allstate2 <- allstate1[order(-allstate1$Pop),] 
#add a column with medical professionals per capita by state
allstate3 <- transform(allstate2, Med.percap = Total.med/Pop))
#add a column with medical professionals per sq km by state
allstate4 <-transform(allstate3, med_prof_per_sq_km = Total.med/Area)
```

Print results.
```{r}
allstate4
```
